# Notes: Water Cycle

## Key Points
- The water cycle describes how water moves across Earth.
- Main steps: Evaporation, Condensation, Precipitation, Collection.
- Driven by Solar Energy.

## Important Terms
- **Evaporation**: Water turning into vapor.
- **Condensation**: Vapor cooling into droplets.
- **Precipitation**: Rain, snow, or hail falling from clouds.

## Real-World Example
- Rainwater fills rivers and lakes, evaporates again — ongoing cycle.

## Summary
The water cycle circulates water between land, oceans, and the atmosphere. It supports life, weather patterns, and ecosystems.
